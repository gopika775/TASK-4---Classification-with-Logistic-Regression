# TASK-4---Classification-with-Logistic-Regression

Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project applies logistic regression to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset.

Tasks Performed  
- Imported and cleaned the dataset  
- Encoded the target feature (diagnosis: M/B â†’ 1/0)  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Standardized the feature set  
- Trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn  
- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Tuned the classification threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.4)  
- Visualized the ROC curve and Precision-Recall vs Threshold curve

Libraries Used  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- sklearn

Final Output  
A trained and evaluated logistic regression model for tumor classification. Performance metrics, evaluation plots, and threshold tuning included to support decision-making in binary classification scenarios.
